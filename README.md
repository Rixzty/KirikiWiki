# Kirikiño Gynkana
This system was designed for Kirikiño Ikastola in order to make a quick punctuation system connected between a web server that counted the total points and sent the data to a Google Drive spreadsheet.

Feel free to download and use the system: https://github.com/Rixzty/kirikinogynkana/releases/tag/BETA
As of now there are no instructions but it has a simple use. If you requiere help open a pull request or email me at admin@rix.dev and I will try helping you.
